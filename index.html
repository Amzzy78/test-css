                        <li>In a sitting or standing position, use the pads of the three middle fingers - examine using
                            light, medium and deep pressure.</li>
                        <li>Examining starts at the collarbone and continues down and up the entire breast in a vertical
                            pattern.</li>
                        <li>Lie on your back in a bed which leads to a more even distribution of your breast tissue.

                    <p>Nobody can say for sure the exact cause of breast cancer in men so prevention methods are hard to
                        say.
                        <br>What we do know is that higher levels of estrogen (or oestrogen) increase your risk,
                        so preventing those higher levels is something we <em>can</em> do.
                        <br>Common causes of estrogen include Obesity, Stress and Cirrhosis of the liver, so losing
                        weight, not
                        drinking too much alcohol and eating a balanced diet may help to prevent male breast cancer.</p>

                    <p class="p-mid">Checking your Pecs regularly is vital so that you understand the normal look and
                        feel of them.
                        You'll more easily be able to identify any abnormalities and catch the changes as soon as
                        possible.</p><br>
                    <p class="p-mid">It is believed that breast cancer is only for women, because men do not have breast like
                        women, but they certainly have breast tissue.
                        Therefore they can also have breast cancer. Although breast cancer is a rare disease in men and
                        it is a percentage of all types of breast cancers.
                        Its diagnosis is significantly less compared to women.</p>

                    <p>See your doctor if you're worried about a breast lump or any other symptom. It's unlikely you
                        have cancer
                        but it's always best to get checked.</p>
